# Project: Diabetes classification using machine learning

The goal of this project is to classify whether a patient has diabetes based on specific health
metrics. We are expected to analyze the dataset, choose appropriate preprocessing
steps, apply classification models, and evaluate their performance.

The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. It can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).

We will start by exploring the data using feature distributions and correlation matrix's. Doing so will grant us with 
a better understanding of the data. 
The data exploration will also consist of dealing with missing or abnormal entries by either replacing them with suitable values or 
just removing them from the dataset.

After that, we will build different predictive models using the suitable python libraries. The goal will be to optimize each one of them 
by tuning the respective hyperparameters.

Finally, we will select the appropriate data features for evaluation by applying the backward selection technique.

You can access more details about implementations in the **main.ipynb** file.
